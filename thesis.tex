\section*{Introduction}
Since the first proposal of HTTP\cite{http-proposal} the Web sites evolved from 
text pages implementing the Request/Response Pattern\cite{request-response}  to  
complex Web applications. Whereas the former draws a clear distinction between a client
who performs a request and a server who sends the response, the latter does not show this 
clear differentiation. Even recently a new communication protocol\cite{web-socket} has been published 
in which the browser acts like a server, thus listening for requests. Tilley and Huang \cite{web-classification} proposed
a new classification scheme for Web applications. They partition Web applications into three different categories:
Class 1 are mainly static Web applications containing static content. Usually these are implemented as plain HTML sites. 
Class 2 are Web applications with some sort of dynamic behavior. Dynamic content is realized witch technologies like Flash\cite{flash},
embedded Java Applet\cite{java-applet}, Javascript or recently CSS3\cite{css3}. 
Class 3 represents the most complex Web applications. In addition to Class 1 and 2 these provide dynamically generated content by server-side technologies
like JSP, PHP, ASP and others. Nowadays most Web applications represent Class 3. Unfortunately developing these requires much more expertise, increasing the
likelihood of defects and often requiring much higher maintenance costs.\\
Probably one of the most challenging aspects are constant changes. P.J.Warren, C.Boldyreff, M.Munro\cite{html-evolution}
presented a study which analyzed six websites. Their study shows a correlation between the complexity and the changes of
a website: The more complex a website get the more likely they will change in the future. 
There are structural and behavioral changes. While the former means changes in the document structure (e.g. Document Object Model\cite{dom} or HTML tree), the latter
includes all changes affecting how Web applications response when an action is performed. 
This requires adaptive testing techniques. Due to the importance of this characteristic a whole section in this thesis outlines the challenges faced
with changing environments.\\ 
Another important aspect is the huge user population. While in the beginnings of the World Wide Web only universities had access,
nowadays the vast majority of the population can view content distributed across all over the world. The typical Web user range from a
mother who does an online shopping tour over a teenager updating the current relationship status in Facebook to a student doing research for
the Bachelor thesis. The integration of designers understanding these different social backgrounds of users is crucial.\\


All of the above characteristics of Web applications make functional testing a difficult task though not impossible.
This thesis first gives an overview of the different testing approaches. For each 
testing method a tool implementing it will be presented.\\

\section{Software Testing}
\cite{art-of-software-testing} defines software testing as "the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors".
According to that one might conclude that finding bugs is the only purpose of software testing. Since TDD\cite{tdd} became popular
another definition coexist: "Software testing is the process of verifying the programs output against predefined values". Besides from 
these IEEE\cite{ieee-testing-definiton} defines software testing as: "The process of operating a system or component under specified conditions, observing or recording the results, and making an evaluation of some aspect of the system or component".\\
\subsection{Testing Techniques}
This section outlines the different software testing techniques\cite{testing-methods} and briefly describes testing methods representing each of
the mentioned techniques in context of Web application testing.
\paragraph{Black-Box Testing} ~\\
This testing technique looks at the code which needs to be tested as a whole. It requires no internal knowledge though test cases are typically 
derived from functional requirements. Therefore some sort of input data is verified against generated outcome.
It is impossible to test all possible input combinations. In \cite{softare-testing-principles} this is named as \textit{Dijkstra's Doctrine}
where for a program accepting a six-character code, ensuring that the first character is numeric and the rest are alphanumeric, an input 
sequence of 9161328320 combinations needs to be generated.
According to \cite{testing-overview} one representative implementing this approach proposed by Di Lucca et al.\cite{decision-table-testing} will be described below.\\
-TODO detail description and explanation of \cite{decision-table-testing}-
\paragraph{White-Box Testing} ~\\
In contrast this technique examines the internals such as code, code structure and control flow. White-Box Testing can be further classified in
static and structural testing. The former does not require executing the code thus the source code is sufficient for examination. The source code
is analyzed either by humans through a code review or by static analysis tools which check for unreachable code, unused variables, memory leaks, use
deprecated libraries and other metrics. The latter executes the program and use the control structure for coverage examination\cite{structural-testing}.\\
-TODO detail description and explanation of \cite{web-whiteBox-testing}-
\paragraph{Grey-Box Testing} ~\\
To clarify the naming conflict, the two terms Grey-Box Testing and Gray-Box Testing are used synonymously in the literature\cite{bridge-grey}. 
In the context of Web applications this new testing technique arises\cite{web-engineering}. Grey-Box Testing is a mixture of Black-Box and White-Box Testing as Grey-Box Testing (Black box + White box = Grey Box).\\
One candidate representing this testing technique is \textit{User-Session based testing}. Though the behavior of Web application is examined like in
Black-Box Testing it requires some internal knowledge (e.g. links to other pages) due to it verifies page or link coverage.\\
